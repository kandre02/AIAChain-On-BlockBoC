                Our platform, <strong>On Block-BoC</strong>, is designed to revolutionize the real estate market using 
                the power of blockchain technology. We aim to provide a seamless, transparent, and 
                secure solution for buying, selling, and transferring real estate ownership through 
                NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and a fiat-pegged stablecoin, EurBoC.
            </p>
            <p className="about-mission">
                By digitizing real estate ownership and embedding these assets on the blockchain, 
                we ensure that property transfers are instantaneous, secure, and cost-effective. 
                Our system also facilitates seamless fiat-to-blockchain transactions using the EurBoC 
                stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the euro.
