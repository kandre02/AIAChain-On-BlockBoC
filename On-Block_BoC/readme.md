# On Block-BoC
![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4179dc1c-1de5-4ed9-9356-fd03d61eeb35)

**On Block-BoC** is an innovative platform that leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize real estate transactions and fiat-to-stablecoin conversion. Built during the BoC Hackathon, this project aims to streamline and automate real estate ownership transfer using NFTs, while also providing a stablecoin, **EurBoC**, pegged 1:1 to the euro, ensuring a smooth transition between traditional banking systems and decentralized finance.

## About the Project

The **On Block-BoC** platform offers a seamless solution for real estate tokenization and fiat-to-crypto exchange, built on **three core smart contracts**:
1. **EurBoC Stablecoin**: A fiat-pegged stablecoin ensuring liquidity and security while leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized yet controlled currency management.
2. **RealEstateNFT**: A smart contract to tokenize real estate assets as NFTs, enabling instant ownership transfers in a fully digitized and immutable way.
3. **Marketplace**: A decentralized platform where users can buy, sell, and trade tokenized real estate using EurBoC.

## Features
- **Fiat-to-Stablecoin Conversion**: Users can easily convert their fiat currency into **EurBoC**, a stablecoin pegged to the euro.
- **Tokenized Real Estate**: Properties are represented as NFTs, making real estate ownership and transfers as simple as sending a token.
- **KYC Compliance**: Users must pass a **Know Your Customer (KYC)** process to ensure regulatory compliance, creating a secure ecosystem for transactions.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Real estate ownership transfers happen instantly, recorded on the blockchain for transparency and security.
- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Users can list, buy, and sell tokenized properties directly in the marketplace using EurBoC.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Built on the **Linea Blockchain** for fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using **Solidity** for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **React.js**: Frontend built using **React** for a modern, responsive user interface.
- **MetaMask**: Wallet integration for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Node.js & Express**: Backend server to handle API calls and balance updates.

## How It Works

1. **Fiat to EurBoC Conversion**: Users can connect their BoC account and convert fiat euros into EurBoC tokens directly from the platform.
2. **Real Estate Tokenization**: Property owners can tokenize their assets by minting NFTs through the **RealEstateNFT** smart contract, where each NFT represents a real property.
3. **Marketplace**: Tokenized real estate NFTs can be listed for sale in the marketplace. Buyers can purchase the property using EurBoC, and ownership is transferred instantly via the blockchain.
4. **KYC Verification**: All transactions require verified users to comply with regulatory standards. Wallets must be KYC-verified before they can receive or send EurBoC or real estate NFTs.
